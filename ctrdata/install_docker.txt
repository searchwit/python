he post-install script:

    Sets the capability on the Docker Desktop binary to map privileged ports and set resource limits.
    Adds a DNS name for Kubernetes to /etc/hosts.
    Creates a symlink from /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli to /usr/bin/docker. 
    This is because the classic Docker CLI is installed at /usr/bin/docker. 
    The Docker Desktop installer also installs a Docker CLI binary that includes cloud-integration capabilities 
    and is essentially a wrapper for the Compose CLI, 
    at/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli. The symlink ensures that the wrapper can access the classic Docker CLI.
